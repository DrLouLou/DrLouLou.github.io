title: LISP Series Intro
---

A week or so ago, I came across Eric Steven Raymond's [guide](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) to hacking and hacker culture - a culture of working on difficult, not necessarily software related problems (not gaining unauthorised access to places). In the section dedicated to basic hacking skills, Raymond says:

"LISP is worth learning for a different reason â€” the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot."

Lisp is the second oldest high-level programming language - a year younger than fortran - meaning many dialects of Lisp are in common use today. This raises the question of which one to learn in the case of a person who has experience mostly in python and a few other high level languages but doesn't know much about true programming fundamentals. I chose scheme, a minimal sort of Lisp good for first timers. The post that will follow will be a comprehensive set of my notes on learning about Scheme, the history, the people behind it, and the code itself. If it goes well, I may continue this note-style format in the future.
