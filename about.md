I'm Louis and I'm currently working remotely as a software developer at a tech startup based in London, but my interests beyond coding are varied. This blog hopes to collect many of those interests in a vaguely organised format. These include but are not limited to: philosophy, the natural and social sciences, rationality, MMA, and music.
